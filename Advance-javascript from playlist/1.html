    console.log("javascript 123");
    // so js is a client side scripted language that we run on the browser
    // the browser has its own js engine and with that it runs the js code
    // for example the google chrome has v8 engine similarly the mozila firefox has spider monkey , and internet explorer has chakra and safari has safari 
    //refer to 1a.png , then 1b.png


    // first the js code is present and then the file is when send to the js engine , now every engine has a parser and that parser parses the js code means the parser checks the code line by line and checks for any syntax error or not and if any error comes then the error is thrown from this parser . if the parser checks every thing is correct then it creates a abstract sysntax tree (AST) . refer-> 1c.html
    
    // once ast is produced then it is converted to the machine code and then the processor of the system understands the machine code and the code runs and the execution is done
