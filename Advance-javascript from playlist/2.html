    // basically what happens is that when the code runs it first gets created in a container caled as the global execution context and after that whenever indivisual function wroks it creates its own separate execution context
    //refer to 2a.png, 2b.png ,  2c.png, 2d 2e 2f
    //note : the global execution context is created by default and it is assiciated with the global object
    // the global object differs from browser to browser like in case of chrome the global object is window
    

    // now what is execution stack  // refer to 2g.png
    //---------------------------------------------------------
    // here it is also known as the calling stack  and it follows LIFO structure .
    // it is used to store all the execution context during the code execution
    // when a function is called then its execution context is pushed into the execution stack
    // once the current function gets executed completely then its execution context is removed from the execution stack
    // once the function call gets over then the execution context is removed from the execution stack
    // so if there are nested calls then each time a function is called it will be added onto the top of the execution stack
